                <p class="boxText">I have always had the attitude that tech shouldn’t be alienating, but should be
                    inclusive and empower individuals to take whatever they are passionate about to the next level. I’ve
                    witness many a Luddite rebuke powerful tools at their disposal due to feeling overwhelmed and
                    intimidated. Users should never feel like their tech is working against them or questioning their
                    intelligence. It’s the duty of good UX to break down barriers and make tech make sense.
                    <br><br>
                    I was immediately intrigued when I first learned of the field of UX. It combines my empathy for
                    making tech more accessible, my passion for researching subject matter soup to nuts, and my desire
                    to inject more creativity from my musically inclined personal life into my work life. I believe UX
                    can better the world one strategically placed button at a time.</p>

                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Overview: </h3>

                    <br><br>

                    Recycle Upcycle was created to combat the landfill and allow user to redefine trash. Disposable
                    items are ubiquitous and yet responsible means for disposal are underused or unknown to users. By
                    allowing users to be inspired to give second life to their unwanted items, Recycle Upcycle ………..

                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Team Size/Role Responsibility </h3>
                    <br><br>

                    The application was created by myself, Nathaniel Higgins, and Mel Perry. We worked in tandem through
                    the research process.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Timeline & Scope</h3>
                    <br>
                    Our timeline was compressed as we had 3 weeks to complete while maintaining our full-time work
                    schedules. Our original focus was on only increasing recycling habits. However, after our research
                    we determined that incorporating a repurpose, or “upcycle,” option for items was critical to our
                    scope.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Problem Statement </h3>
                    <br>
                    Recycling isn’t always as easy as finding a blue bin. Even the most eco-conscious recyclers are
                    unsure of how to properly recycle everyday items and where to recycle items not meant for curbside
                    recycling. Additionally, some items are better repurposed, or Upcycled, rather than being tossed
                    away.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Target Users</h3>
                    <br>
                    Our target users are people between 30 and 60 who are already have a relationship to recycling and
                    want to increase their practice.
                    <br>
                    Our primary persona, Jen Teller, is a young urban professional who already has a strong relationship
                    with recycling but is seeking better tools to increase her recycling routine.

                    <br>

                    <div class="caseStudyImg persona1Jen">

                    </div>

                    Our secondary persona, Raina Gaines, is a middle class suburban mom who has a broader concern
                    incorporating eco-conscious activities, but lacks motivation to make it a major priority.


                    <br>
                    <div class="caseStudyImg persona2Gaines"></div>

                    <br>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Process & What You Did</h3>
                    <br>
                    The first step was to explore the market and examine the competition. We broke down other’s
                    competitive edge and weaknesses to inform how we could model our project to meet the users’ needs.
                    <br>
                    The next step was to conduct a series of interviews with candidates that fit into our target user.
                    We used the data collected from the interviews to inform a digital survey with Google Forms.
                    <br>
                    <div class="caseStudyImg surveyData"></div>
                    <br>

                    These initial processes created the raw data that we used to ideate and iterate. We took the raw
                    data, looked for patterns, and noted our significant findings. Then we took these nuggets of data
                    and organized them into an Affinity Diagram.

                    <div class="caseStudyImg affinityDiagram"></div>

                    <br>

                    From here we were able to ideate using the I Like, I Wish, What If method and prioritize these
                    ideas.
                    <br>
                    <div class="caseStudyImg featurePrioritization"></div>
                    <br>
                    We took our findings and distilled what the user deemed important into our main goals:

                    <span class="listTitle">Educate</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to recycle</li>
                        <li>Where to recycle</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="listTitle">Engage</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve recycling consistency & routine</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Which then informed our three main functions:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scan to find items</li>
                        <li>Clear, concise recycling guidelines</li>
                        <li>Positive Reinforcement - clean up the park, earn points, and unlock other “EnviroScenes”
                            through achievements</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">The Pivot</h3>
                    <br>
                    During this whole process we were still consistently doing research. In that research we came upon
                    an exposé on American recycling habits which made us reconsider our focus. The article pointed out
                    how China, the leading purchasers or America’s recycled goods, had recently updated their policy on
                    plastics and would no longer accept much of America’s recycled goods which in turn has begun to be
                    shipped and dumped on impoverished nations. This striking discovery forced us to totally reconsider
                    the trajectory of our project. Is recycling doing more harm than good? Can we promote a product that
                    promotes sending our trash overseas? This was certainly an ethical dilemma.
                    <br>
                    Challenges such as these are a good thing though because they promote creativity and new ideas. We
                    used this recycling revelation to fuel our big pivot to make repurposing unwanted items, or
                    “upcycling,” as a new focus of the app. If recycling certain goods could cause harm, we could have
                    our app promote repurposing and giving unwanted items a second life.
                    <br>
                    Now we had four main functionality components:
                    <br>
                    ol>
                    <li>Scan to find items</li>
                    <li>Clear, concise recycling guidelines</li>
                    <li>Positive Reinforcement - clean up the park, earn points, and unlock other “EnviroScenes” through
                        achievements</li>
                    <li class="listEmphasize">Clear, concise recycling guidelines</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Process To Prototype</h3>
                    <br>
                    Then began the rapid sketching of wireframes to inform a final prototype. These initial sketches
                    were then incorporated into a lo-fi clickable prototype for our first round of user testing.
                    <br>
                    <div class="wireframeCont">
                        <div class="caseStudyImg sketchHome"></div>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg sketchItem"></div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    From our first round of user testing with sketched prototypes we came to the following results:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add “scan” feature to bottom menu nav</li>
                        <li>Add button to scan</li>
                        <li>Show points on top of the home screen</li>
                        <li>Make EnviroPoints one page</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    The next move was to create an updated clickable prototype using Adobe XD. We used the results from
                    the initial user testing and also referenced our previous work to inform the more crystalized
                    design.
                    <br>
                    <div class="caseStudyImg prototypeAddition"></div>
                    <br>
                    Then began another round of user testing to better our overall design.
                    <br>
                    <div class="caseStudyImg userTestingResults"></div>
                    <br>
                    Above you can see that we added the Home indicator at the top to better meet iOS standards; we added
                    a Scan button on the bottom navigation; and we included the EnviroPoints on the home page.
                    <br>
                    The user testing assisted in focusing the goal of the application and fine-tuning the style. See the
                    visualized start to finish process below:

                    <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <br>
                    Our recycling app went in a different direction than originally anticipated. However, we believe
                    that trusting research and continually looping back to various stages of the design process serves
                    to strengthen the overall concept.
                    <br>
                    We found that the design process is about the evolution of an initial idea. Most importantly, good
                    research cannot be underestimated.
