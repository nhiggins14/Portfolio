                    <p class="boxText">I have always had the attitude that tech shouldn’t be alienating, but should be inclusive and empower individuals to take whatever they are passionate about to the next level. I’ve witness many a Luddite rebuke powerful tools at their disposal due to feeling overwhelmed and intimidated. Users should never feel like their tech is working against them or questioning their intelligence. It’s the duty of good UX to break down barriers and make tech make sense.
                        <br><br>
                            I was immediately intrigued when I first learned of the field of UX. It combines my empathy for making tech more accessible, my passion for researching subject matter soup to nuts, and my desire to inject more creativity from my musically inclined personal life into my work life. I believe UX can better the world one strategically placed button at a time.</p>

                        Overview: <br><br>

                        Recycle Upcycle was created to combat the landfill and allow user to redefine trash. Disposable items are ubiquitous and yet responsible means for disposal are underused or unknown to users. By allowing users to be inspired to give second life to their unwanted items, Recycle Upcycle ………..
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Team Size/Role Responsibility<br><br>
                        
                        The application was created by myself, Nathaniel Higgins, and Mel Perry. We worked in tandem through the research process. 
                        <br><br>
                        Timeline & Scope<br>
                        Our timeline was compressed as we had 3 weeks to complete while maintaining our full-time work schedules. Our original focus was on only increasing recycling habits. However, after our research we determined that incorporating a repurpose, or “upcycle,” option for items was critical to our scope. 
                        <br><br>
                        Problem Statement <br>
                        Recycling isn’t always as easy as finding a blue bin. Even the most eco-conscious recyclers are unsure of how to properly recycle everyday items and where to recycle items not meant for curbside recycling. Additionally, some items are better repurposed, or Upcycled, rather than being tossed away.
                        <br><br>
                        Target Users<br>
                        Our target users are people between 30 and 60 who are already have a relationship to recycling and want to increase their practice. 
                        <br>
                        Our primary persona, Jen Teller, is a young urban professional who already has a strong relationship with recycling but is seeking better tools to increase her recycling routine.
                        
                        <br>

                        <img src=
                        
                        Our secondary persona, Raina Gaines, is a middle class suburban mom who has a broader concern incorporating eco-conscious activities, but lacks motivation to make it a major priority.
                        
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Process & What You Did<br>
                        The first step was to explore the market and examine the competition. We broke down other’s competitive edge and weaknesses to inform how we could model our project to meet the users’ needs.
                        <br>
                        The next step was to conduct a series of interviews with candidates that fit into our target user. We used the data collected from the interviews to inform a digital survey with Google Forms. 
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        These initial processes created the raw data that we used to ideate and iterate. We took the raw data, looked for patterns, and noted our significant findings. Then we took these nuggets of data and organized them into an Affinity Diagram. 
                        
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        From here we were able to ideate using the I Like, I Wish, What If method and prioritize these ideas. 
                        
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        The Pivot<br>
                        
                        During this whole process we were still consistently doing research. In that research we came upon an expose on American recycling habits which made us reconsider our focus. The article pointed out how China, the leading purchasers or America’s recycled goods, had recently updated their policy on plastics and would no longer accept much of America’s recycled goods which in turn has begun to be shipped and dumped on impoverished nations. This striking discovery forced us to totally reconsider the trajectory of our project. Is recycling doing more harm than good? Can we promote a product that promotes sending our trash overseas? This was an ethical dilemma. 
                        
                        Problems are a good thing though because they promote creativity and new ideas. We used this recycling revelation to fuel our big pivot to make repurposing unwanted items, or “upcycling,” as a new focus of the app. If recycling certain goods could cause harm, we could have our app promote repurposing and giving unwanted items a second life.
