                <p class="boxText">I have always had the attitude that tech shouldn’t be alienating, but should be
                    inclusive and empower individuals to take whatever they are passionate about to the next level. I’ve
                    witness many a Luddite rebuke powerful tools at their disposal due to feeling overwhelmed and
                    intimidated. Users should never feel like their tech is working against them or questioning their
                    intelligence. It’s the duty of good UX to break down barriers and make tech make sense.
                    <br><br>
                    I was immediately intrigued when I first learned of the field of UX. It combines my empathy for
                    making tech more accessible, my passion for researching subject matter soup to nuts, and my desire
                    to inject more creativity from my musically inclined personal life into my work life. I believe UX
                    can better the world one strategically placed button at a time.</p>

                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Overview</h3>

                        <p>
                            Recycle Upcycle was created to introduce the user to the idea of repurposing refuse in order
                            to increase the life span of everyday objects with the end goal of combatting the landfill.
                            Disposable items are ubiquitous and yet a responsible means for disposal are underused or
                            unknown to users. By allowing users to share inspirational ideas on how to give a second
                            life to their unwanted items, Recycle Upcycle navigates the upcycling waters and breathes
                            new life into unwanted items.<br>
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Team Size/Role Responsibility</h3>

                        <p>
                            The application was created by myself, Nathaniel Higgins, and Mel Perry. We worked in tandem
                            through the research and design process.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Timeline & Scope</h3>
                        <p>We had an expedited, 3-week timeline to research, design and present this concept. . Our
                            original scope was to increase recycling habits. However, after our initial research we
                            determined that incorporating a repurpose, or “upcycle,” option for items was critical to
                            our success.
                        </p>


                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p>
                            Recycling isn’t always as easy as finding a blue bin. Even the most eco-conscious recyclers
                            are unsure of how to properly recycle everyday items and where to recycle items not meant
                            for curbside recycling. Additionally, some items are better repurposed, or upcycled, rather
                            than being tossed away.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Provide a tool that educates the user on clear recycling guidelines, locate appropriate
                            recycling locations, and incentivise eco-conscious individuals who want to improve their
                            recycling routine, by rewarding engagement and encouraging users to build a community of
                            like-minded recycling creatives, all in an effort to have an overall significant impact on
                            the environment.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Target Users</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our target users are people between 30 and 60 who are already have a relationship to
                            recycling and want to increase their practice.
                            <br>
                            Our primary persona, Jen Teller, is a young urban professional who already has a strong
                            relationship with recycling but is seeking better tools to increase her recycling routine.
                        </p>

                        <div class="caseStudyImg persona1Jen"></div>
                        <p>
                            Our secondary persona, Raina Gaines, is a middle class suburban mom who has a broader
                            concern incorporating eco-conscious activities, but lacks motivation to make it a major
                            priority.
                        </p>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg persona2Gaines"></div>
                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first step was to explore the market and perform a competitive analysis on existing
                            recycling-geared apps. We broke down other’s competitive edge and weaknesses to inform how
                            we could model our project to meet the users’ needs.
                            <br>
                            The next step was to conduct a series of interviews with candidates that fit into our target
                            user base. We used the data collected from the interviews to inform and build a digital
                            survey with Google Forms.
                        </p>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg surveyData"></div>
                        <p>
                            These initial processes created the raw data that we used to ideate and iterate. We took the
                            raw data, identified patterns, and noted our significant findings. Then we took these
                            nuggets of data and organized them into an Affinity Diagram.
                        </p>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg affinityDiagram"></div>
                        <p>
                            From here we were able to ideate using the I Like, I Wish, What If method and prioritize
                            these ideas.
                        </p>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg featurePrioritization"></div>
                      <br>
                            We took our findings and distilled what the user deemed important into our main goals:
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="listTitle">Educate</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How to recycle</li>
                                <li>Where to recycle</li>
                            </ul>
                            <span class="listTitle">Engage</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Improve recycling consistency & routine</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Which then informed our three main functions:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Scan to find items</li>
                                <li>Clear, concise recycling guidelines</li>
                                <li>Positive Reinforcement - clean up the park, earn points, and unlock other
                                    “EnviroScenes”
                                    through achievements</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                      
                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">The Pivot</h3>
                        <p>
                            During this whole process we were still collecting research. Well into the design phase of
                            this project, we came upon an exposé on American recycling habits which made us reconsider
                            our focus. The article pointed out how China, the leading purchasers or America’s recycled
                            goods, had recently updated their policy on plastics and would no longer accept much of
                            America’s recycled goods which in turn has begun to be shipped and dumped on impoverished
                            nations. This striking discovery forced us to totally reconsider the trajectory of our
                            project. Is recycling doing more harm than good? Can we promote a product that promotes
                            sending our trash overseas? This was certainly an ethical dilemma.
                            <br>
                            Challenges such as these are a good thing though because they promote creativity and new
                            ideas. We used this recycling revelation to fuel our big pivot to make repurposing unwanted
                            items, or “upcycling,” as a new focus of the app. If recycling certain goods could cause
                            harm, we could have our app promote repurposing and giving unwanted items a second life.
                        </p>

                        Now we had four main functionality components:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Scan to find items</li>
                            <li>Clear, concise recycling guidelines</li>
                            <li>Positive Reinforcement - clean up the park, earn points, and unlock other “EnviroScenes”
                                through
                                achievements</li>
                            <li> <span class="listEmphasize">Clear, concise recycling guidelines</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="caseSubTitle">Process To Prototype</h3>
                        <p>
                            Then began the rapid sketching of wireframes to inform a final prototype. These initial
                            sketches were then incorporated into a lo-fi clickable prototype for our first round of user
                            testing.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <div class="wireframeCont">

                    </div> -->
                        <br>
                        From our first round of user testing with sketched prototypes we came to the following results:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ol>

                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            The next move was to create an updated clickable prototype using Adobe XD. We used the
                            results from the initial user testing and also referenced our previous work to inform the
                            more crystalized design.
                        </p>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg prototypeAddition"></div>
                        <p>
                            Then began another round of user testing to better our overall design.
                        </p>
                        <div class="caseStudyImg userTestingResults"></div>
                        <p>
                            Above you can see that we added the Home indicator at the top to better meet iOS standards;
                            we added a Scan button on the bottom navigation; and we included the EnviroPoints on the
                            home page.
                            <br>
                            The user testing assisted in focusing the goal of the application and fine-tuning the style. See the visualized start to finish process below:

                        <p>
                                Our recycling app went in a different direction than originally anticipated. However, we believe that trusting research and continually looping back to various stages of the design process serves to strengthen the overall concept.
                        <br>
                        We found that the design process is about the evolution of an initial idea. Most importantly, good research cannot be underestimated.
